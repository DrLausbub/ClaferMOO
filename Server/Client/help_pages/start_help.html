Press the '?' button of each window to see specific help. In general:

-- Use the input view to select a <i>.cfr</i> model and optimize it.

-- Use the Bubble Front Graph window to visually explore the Pareto front.

-- Use the Feature and Quality Matrix View to filter the instances by selecting and eliminating features.
